## Favorite Movie
One of my all-time favorite movies is *Darling*, a Telugu movie. I love it because of the heartwarming storyline, the fantastic performance of the lead actors, and the engaging music. The movie has a great mix of romance, comedy, and drama, making it an emotional rollercoaster. It's a feel-good film that always puts a smile on my face!
