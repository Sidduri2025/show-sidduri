## Code Fencing Example
This Node.js code snippet demonstrates how to create a simple HTTP server that responds with a text message.
```Node.js
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {

	response.writeHead(200, {
		'Content-Type': 'text/plain'
	});
	response.write('Hello from Pieces!');
	response.end();

}).listen(8080);

console.log('server running on port 8080');
